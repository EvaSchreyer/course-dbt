**A question to think about: Why might certain products be converting at higher/lower rates than others? Note: we don't actually have data to properly dig into this, but we can make some hypotheses.**
Reasons why products convert at higher/lower rates:
- price
- product lifecycle - is the product new or old?
- product description (does the product drive a lot of traffic that is not meant for this product because users think its something else?
- user groups - maybe certain products are only bought by certain user groups that are less likely to buy

**dbt package I used:**
I used the macro star from the dbt package dbt_utils in my int_product_page_views to exclude the column page_url
